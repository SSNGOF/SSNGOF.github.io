            	<h3>What is the South Sudan NGO Forum?</h3>
                <p>The NGO Forum was created in the early 1990â€™s as a coordination mechanism for NGOs under Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS); it was originally located in Nairobi where most NGOs were then based. In 2006, with the move of many organizations into Southern Sudan, the NGO Forum began to meet monthly in Juba, and now includes non-OLS members and National NGOs (NNGOs). The Forum was created to discuss issues around programming, humanitarian financing, delivery of humanitarian aid, and access to services. The NGO Forum began as a voluntary body that operated by a Terms of Reference with an annually elected Steering Committee.</p>
                <p>In mid-2008 the work of the NGO Forum came under the facilitation of a full-time office called the NGO Secretariat. From its inception until mid-2010, the Secretariat was funded by DFID and administered by Catholic Relief Services. In August 2010, the NGO Forum moved to a membership model and the Secretariat was funded by NGO members as well as ECHO. The Secretariat is currently administered by TearFund, under grants from Swedish SIDA, Swiss SDC and ECHO.
