                <p>The South Sudan Knowledge Network concept is an information platform where researchers, students, NGOâ€™s, governmental agencies can post their research for dissemination to a wide audience and is internet based. The platform would allow all types of academic research, studies and assessments, conducted by universities, organisations and institutions to be placed on the platform. Once posted the platform would become a virtual library of research undertaken in South Sudan and would become a living knowledge network that could grow over time.

				<b>Background</b>
				The concept developed by the Dutch Consortium for Rehabilitation in collaboration with the University of Juba the Sudd Institute and the South Sudan NGO forum. All organisations have a mandate to share and support information collection which makes the collaboration suitable.  
				The South Sudan Knowledge Network aims to provide an internet platform that can be accessed by students, academics and policy makers through a no/low cost platform
				 After discussions with representatives from the University of Juba (Dec 2014), who explained the challenges the students face trying to access information on the internet an alternative idea was developed. Research and information collected, could be downloaded onto a flash drive, which will be delivered to the university library very quarter which will be able to be accessed by the students. 
				Thus while the platform will be online a version will be available off line to allow students and researcher to be able to access information through the universities computes off line. This would provide an alternative for students/researchers and academics who do not have regular access to the internet.
				What the Knowledge Network is Not, the knowledge network is not political discussion group. The country is currently in conflict and the group would need to maintain independence. 
				Also the KN does not approve research proposals and review and approve research reports. The network is a place where research can be most importantly shared to a wide audience, particular students and organisations that can build and further research in particular fields. Criteria for the publication will be developed by the SSKN committee.
				Furthermore it may be a place where researchers within and outside South Sudan could be able to highlight their work and credentials to a wider academic audience.
