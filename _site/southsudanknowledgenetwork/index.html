            <p>The South Sudan Knowledge Network is an information platform where research on South Sudan is collected and housed. It is a one stop shop for research conducted on South Sudan that is available for public access. It does not include private journals or private research databases.</p>
            <p>Researchers, institutions, non-governmental organizations,  government departments and others  are encouraged to submit completed research to the South Sudan Knowledge Network should they wish to share research papers publicly and at no cost. Similarly, they are encouraged to use the database for their own research initiatives.</p>
            <p>The platform allows all types of academic research, studies and assessments conducted by universities, independent researchers, organizations and institutions to be placed on the platform, however papers must have a South Sudan or regional relevance.</p>
            <p>The aim of the platform is to develop a virtual library of resources on South Sudan that grows over time owing to contributions by users.</p>
            <p>The database will be downloaded every 3 months and submitted to the University of Juba main library. This enables students and academics to access the database offline, through the library borrowing system and provides access to research papers without needing to pay costly fees to undertake hours of research on the internet</p>

        	<p>The concept of the South Sudan Knowledge Network was developed by the Dutch Consortium for Rehabilitation in collaboration with the University of Juba the Sudd Institute and the South Sudan NGO forum. All organizations are operating in Juba, South Sudan and share a mandate to undertake and share research to support their activities.</p>

            <h3>The Dutch Consortium for Rehabilitation</h3>
            <p>The Dutch Consortium for Rehabilitation (DCR) is a collaborative venture of four non-governmental organizations (ZOA, Save the Children, CARE and HealthNet TPO), currently implementing a 5-year programme financed by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The DCR works together with communities in 6 fragile states on the rehabilitation of service delivery and local economies. These countries are South Sudan, Uganda, DR Congo, Burundi, Liberia and Sudan. Activities include improving basic services, creating employment opportunities, and strengthening civil society. The DCR aims to contribute to greater stability and sustainable economic growth in these six (post)conflict countries, since these are ultimately the best weapons against war (for more information, see <a style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.dcr-africa.org/en">dcr-africa.org</a>).
			DCR has undertaken applied research in each of the 6 countries which focus on:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Local development;</li>
				<li>Accountability of local governance; </li>
				<li>Inclusion of the poorest;</li>
				<li>Conflict sensitivity;</li>
				<li>Adult literacy and livelihoods;</li>
				<li>Partnership.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Research is used to inform programs and are available on this site.
