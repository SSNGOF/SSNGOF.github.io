					The NGO Forum internship initiative is four-month long opportunity designed to benefit fresh bachelor’s degree or diploma graduates or graduates with no work experience by placing them within pre-selected NGOs for a specified period of time so as to gain work experience and improve their resumes and chances of getting employment within the humanitarian and/or development sector.<br />
					<strong>Priority will be given to South Sudanese individuals aged 18 to 27 who hold bachelor’s or master’s degrees from recognised and accredited universities/institutions.</strong>
				</p>
				<h3>PURPOSE OF THE INTERNSHIP INITIATIVE:</h3>
				<p>
					The purpose of the internship is to provide an opportunity for individuals to substantively contribute to and learn from the work of the pre-selected NGOs who will be hosting them. The intern will be given specific tasks and responsibilities and will be challenged to develop their competencies and gain experiences. The intern is expected to be professional, responsible, flexible and to take part in various activities at the office and sometimes in the field.
				</p>
				<p>
					The NGO secretariat will pre-select NGOs from its membership through a pre-qualification process and each NGO will be allowed to specify the number of interns they wish to host for the 4 months period. During the 4 months period, interns will be assigned to departments that fit their qualification, area of training and area of interest as expressed in their motivation letter. However where possible an intern can be assigned to more than one department.
				</p>
				<p>
					The departments are organized in two broad areas; <br />
					<strong>1.	SUPPORT DEPARTMENT: </strong> which includes but not limited to administration and finance, procurement and logistics, human resources.<br />
					<strong>2.	PROGRAM DEPARTMENT: </strong> which includes but not limited to monitoring and evaluation, communications, policy engagement, community engagement, protection and peace building work, food security, health, education, water and sanitation, Nutrition among others.
